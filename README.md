# Texture-reCreator
An online tool to check the image tileing while 3D rendering

an texure image on left will genrate an texure as on right
<p align="left">
  <img src="img/sam_i.jpg" width="300">
    <img src="img/sam_i_ren.jpg" width="300">
</p>

what we are doing here is we are takeing a image multplying it to four image like below and then applying to 3d model , this will not affect an good texure image. 
<p align="left">
  <img src="img/sam_f.jpg" width="300">
</p>

now the trick is we an also tile the images in non-linear patten like 
not affect an good texure image. 
<p align="left">
  <img src="img/sam_f_nl.jpg" width="300">
</p>

which can genrate a pritty good sample when appled to 3D model, without any seam.
